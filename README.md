# Remind

> A simple workflow to open the reminders app and create a new reminder.

## Usage

Use Alfred keyword `remind` and add text to be used for a new reminder in the [Apple Reminders app](https://support.apple.com/de-de/guide/reminders/welcome/mac).

Alternatively set a hotkey to launch the Apple Reminders app. It will receive the selected text as the new reminder text.

## Background of the idea

I've used the [`/remind`](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) command of [Slack](https://slack.com/) a lot, because it's very useful - at least in my opinion. As my company switched to [MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), which doesn't offer this handy feature, I used Alfred to get a similar productive workflow.

For instance, if I want to set a resubmission to a MS Teams message, I [copy the URL of the message](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/how-to-find-chat-message-links-in-teams/418d4cbd-c829-4abd-92fa-5d44d262e3e4), call the `remind` keyword in Alfred and paste the URL immediately after this. Then, I set a time, done.
